// This is a sketch written for a base. The base is a moteino that acts as a gateway between 
// a PC and other moteinos. It is connected to the PC through a serial port and relays info
// to and from the radio network.

// The sketch is a mash up between the gateway, struct send and the struct recieve sketches 
// of the moteino library.
